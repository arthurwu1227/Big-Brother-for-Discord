# Big-Brother-for-Discord
A discord moderation bot which uses the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm to automatically delete messages it finds suspicious.

Please use training data which reflects your own server's moderation history. I did not provide the training data I used to preserve the privacy of my server's members. I have included two sample models in the sample_models folder. They are meant for testing purposes only as their accuracy score is quite low. Please use my code to train your own Naive Bayes classifier to best fit the needs of your own discord server.
